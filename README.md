ALERT
This will change a registry value. 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem LongPathsEnabled to 1.
Apparently Microsoft made long file paths a thing, but did not enable it.
You can learn more about Long File Paths here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation
This will install Chocolatey, Image Magick, and Blender if it is not installed already.
You can learn more about Chocolatey here https://chocolatey.org/
You can learn more about Image Magick here https://chocolatey.org/packages/imagemagick
You can learn more about Blender here https://chocolatey.org/packages/blender

This program is in the beginning stages. There are still alot of changes and cleanup that need to be made.
But for the most part it works and the base is there.
If this gains any interest from anyone I will continue to update. 
If it doesnt then I wont.

Great News I have received permission from HughesMDflyer4 to include the MSFSLayoutGenerator.
You can learn all about it here https://github.com/HughesMDflyer4/MSFSLayoutGenerator

Only for Windows 64bit systems. If there is a large demand for 32bit for some reason, I will update.
The executable will open the file for you in blender and wait until you close blender to do the rest.
This will allow you to modify the interior and exterior.

How to use.
Run the .exe It should open Blender. Make changes as you wish. Save over textures.
Once you close blender then the program will finish converting and moving files for you.

TO DO:
Clean up the blender file. Outside the fuselage parts are goofy.
Satisfy curious of what it would take to add seats to the back.
